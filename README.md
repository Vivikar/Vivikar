### Hey there ğŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student at the University of Lausanne | Center for Biomedical Imaging.

- ğŸ§  I'm currently working on a project aiming to tackle domain shifts that arise when using DL models in pediatric neuroimaging, in tasks like super-resolution reconstruction, brain tissue segmentation and quality control.

<!--
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring synthetic data and multi-task self-supervised learning approaches. 
I am thrilled about combining neuroscience, psychology and DL in my work. We have a lot to learn and explore at the intersection of these fields âœ¨
**Vivikar/Vivikar** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
