### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I am a master's student specializing in Medical Imaging and Applications. I am currently working on my master's thesis project on learning cortex morphology with self-supervised contrastive learning for improving sulci segmentations.

I am thrilled about combining neuroscience, psychology and DL in my work. We have a lot to learn and explore at the intersection of these fields âœ¨
